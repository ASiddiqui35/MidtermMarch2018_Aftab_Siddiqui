Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. To orgainize and save data. It also allows easy access.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Create, Update, Search and Detele.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Banking, Academia, Social Media, eCommerce. Basically everywhere where people have to deal with information.
what is an Array?
A. Array is a data structure.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array has fixed size and ArrayList can grow dynamically.
what is LinkedList?
A. Data structures composed of nodes containing next node address and data.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. Same as Array vs. ArrayList.
what is queue?
A. It is a data structure that follow first in first out and last in last out which is opposite of stack.
what is stack?
A. Stack is a data structure that follows FILO and LIFO.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. These are the short version for first in fisrst out and last in first out accordingly.
what is the order of complexity?
A.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. If the elemnt that we are looking for is the first one in the array.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. If the element is located in the at the end of the array.
what is tree in data structure?
A.Tree is a hierarchical non linear data structure.
what is graph in data structure?
A. Graph data structre is composed of data, address and vertices. This data structure optimises route.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.HashTable is synchronized and does not accept null keys or values and HasMap is unsynchronized and accepts null values
    null keys.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. It the exception for searching, inserting elments with index that are outside of the arrays size. Occurs when such
    request are made.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. Using for loops, arraycopy method from System class or clone() method from object class.
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. Array is like a container that holds data and linked list abstract.
What is DFS and BFS?
A.Depth first search and breadth frist search are algorithms fro traversing and searching in Graph data structure.
What is Recursion?
A. It is the process of the method calling itself.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A.In linear data structures data is organized in a sequential fashion meaning one is places after the other. In non linear
    data placement is not sequential, one data can be connected to multiple other.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. It is the notation for represting the time complexity of the sorting algorithms.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A. i. Selection Sort:
   ii. Merge Sort.
   iii. Shell Sort.
   iv. Insertion Sort.
   v. Bubble sort: Assumes the left most item the lareges and keeps comparing it to the elements on the right, upon finding
   larger element it stops moving to the right and the newly found lager one does the same util the lagest value occupies
   the right most postion.
   vi. Bucket Sort.
   vii. Quick Sort.
   viii. Heap Sort.

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
